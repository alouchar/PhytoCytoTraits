# PhytoCytoTraits

This programme aims to sort automatedly flow cytometry traits through a user friendly graphical interface. The application provide basic but complete pipeline for flow cytometry data, from QA-QC to unsupervised classifications.

## Installation

**R environment**

The version 1.0 of the PhytoCytoTraits application needs a recent version of R (version 4.3.x or upper). It is not available on the CRAN website.

The R-packages needed by PhytoCytoTraits application are: cluster, CytoDx, dbscan, dplyr, DT, flowcore, gdata, ggExtra, ggplot2, markdown, plotly, shiny, shinyalert, shinycssloaders, shinydashboard, shinyFiles, shinyjs, shinyWidgets and, V8.

CytoDx package can be download using BiocManager package. 

**Installation**

## Graphical User Interface
